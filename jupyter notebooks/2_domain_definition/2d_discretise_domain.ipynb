    "Domain discretization is a crucial step in processed based hydrological modeling, where we divide our study area into smaller, more geophysically representative units. In CONFLUENCE, this process involves creating Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) based on various geospatial characteristics. This notebook will guide you through the different discretization methods available in CONFLUENCE.\n",
